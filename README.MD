What it does:

This module is creating a html file, which leads us to the page where is a map with three different mark layers, firs shows a current location of user, second shows 10 nearest films to the current location and third shows five highest mountains on Earth.

Description of tags:

<!DOCTYPE html> - defines a document type
<script> - defines a client-side script
<style> - defines a style information for a document
<body> - defines a document`s body
<head> - defines a header for a document or section
<div> - defines a section in a document
<link> - defines the relationship between a document and an external resource

Launching process:

For working with this file you have to install few libraries:
1. geopy
2. folium
3. geopy.distance

To launch a program enter:
python3 map_creation.py

Example of launching:

year = 2016
location = 23.455, 65.64646
open file from repository: Task_example.png(for map with all layers)
open file from repository: Task_example_1.png(For map with layer of your current location)
open file from repository: Task_Example_3.png(map with films near you)
open file from repository: Task_Example_4.png(for map with five highest mountains)

Coclusion:

This map allows you to find films from a year you would like and can help you get to know something new. Also you can see where are located five highest mountains on Earth. This task helped us learn how to create or html-pages and how to work with folium library.
